#
# In this kata we want to convert a string into an integer. The strings simply
# represent the numbers in words.
#
# Examples:
#
# "one" => 1
# "twenty" => 20
# "two hundred forty-six" => 246
# "seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen" => 783919
# Additional Notes:
#
# The minimum number is "zero" (inclusively)
# The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)
# The "and" in e.g. "one hundred and twenty-four" is optional, in some cases it's
# present and in others it's not
# All tested numbers are valid, you don't need to validate them
